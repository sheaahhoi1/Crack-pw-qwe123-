                                        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    {one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}
    Copyright (C) {year}  {name of author}

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    {project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

                    GNU通用公共許可證
                       版本3，2007年6月29日

 版權所有（C）2007免費軟件基金會公司<http://fsf.org/>
 每個人都被允許複製和分發逐字副本
 的許可證文件，但不允許更改它。

                            前言

  GNU通用公共許可證是免費的，Copyleft許可證
軟件等各種作品。

  設計了大多數軟件和其他實際工程的許可證
剝奪你分享和改變作品的自由。相比之下，
GNU通用公共許可證旨在保證您的自由
分享和更改所有版本的程序 - 確保它保持免費
所有用戶的軟件。我們自由軟件基金會使用
我們大部分軟件的GNU通用公共許可證; 它也適用於
任何其他作品都以這種方式發布。你可以應用它
你的節目也是。

  當我們談論自由軟件時，我們指的是自由，而不是自由
價錢。我們的公共許可證旨在確保您
可以自由分發免費軟件的副本（並收取費用）
他們如果你願意），你收到的源代碼或可以得到它，如果你
想要它，你可以更改軟件或使用它的新部分
免費的程序，你知道你可以做這些事情。

  為了保護您的權利，我們需要防止其他人拒絕您
這些權利或者要求你放棄權利。所以你有
如果您分發軟件的副本，或者如果
你修改它：責任尊重他人的自由。

  例如，如果您分發此類程序的副本，是否
免費或收費，您必須傳遞給收件人相同
你收到的自由 你也必須確保他們也收到
或者可以得到源代碼。你必須向他們顯示這些條款，以便他們
知道他們的權利

  使用GNU GPL的開發人員通過兩個步驟保護您的權利：
（1）聲明軟件版權，（2）向您提供本許可證
允許您複製，分發和/或修改它的法定許可。

  對於開發者和作者的保護，GPL清楚地解釋
這個免費軟件沒有保修。對於用戶和
作者的緣故，GPL要求將修改後的版本標記為
改變了，所以他們的問題不會被錯誤地歸因於
以前版本的作者。

  某些設備旨在拒絕用戶訪問安裝或運行
修改後的軟件版本，儘管製造商
可以這樣做 這根本不符合目的
保護用戶更改軟件的自由。系統的
這種濫用的模式發生在個人的產品領域
使用，這正是它最不可接受的地方。所以我們
設計了這個版本的GPL來禁止那些實踐
產品。如果在其他領域出現這樣的問題，我們就可以
隨時準備在未來的版本中將這一規定擴展到這些域名
的GPL，以保護用戶的自由。

  最後，每個程序都受到軟件專利的不斷威脅。
各國不應允許專利限制發展和使用
通用計算機上的軟件，但在那些我們希望的
避免專利適用於免費節目的特殊危險
使其有效地專有。為了防止這種情況，GPL保證
專利不能用於使程序不自由。

  複製，分發的準確條款和條件
修改跟隨。

                       條款和條件

  定義。

  “本許可”是指GNU通用公共許可證的第3版。

  “版權”也是適用於其他類型的類似版權的法律
作品，如半導體面具。

  “程序”是指根據此許可的任何受版權保護的作品
執照。每個被許可人被稱為“你”。“被許可人”和
“收件人”可以是個人或組織。

  要“修改”工作，從全部或部分工作中復製或調整工作
以需要版權許可的方式，除了製作
準確的副本。所產生的工作稱為“修改版本”
早期的工作或工作“基於”早期的工作。

  “被覆蓋的工作”是指未經修改的計劃或基於工作
在程序上。

  為了“傳播”一個工作，意味著做任何事情，沒有
允許，直接或次要的責任
侵權行為適用的版權法除外
計算機或修改私人副本。傳播包括複製，
分發（有或沒有修改），提供給
公眾，還有一些國家也有其他活動。

  為了“傳達”一個工作，意味著任何可以實現其他傳播的傳播
製作或接收副本的各方。只與用戶通過互動
沒有轉讓副本的計算機網絡沒有傳達。

  交互式用戶界面顯示“適當的法律聲明”
在一定程度上它包括一個方便和突出的可見
特點是（1）顯示適當的版權聲明，（2）
告訴用戶工作沒有保修（除了
提供保證的範圍），被許可人可以傳達
根據本許可證進行工作，以及如何查看本許可證的副本。如果
該界面顯示用戶命令或選項的列表，如a
菜單中，列表中的突出項目符合此標準。

  源代碼。

  工作的“源代碼”意味著工作的首選形式
進行修改。“對象代碼”是指任何非源代碼
工作形式

  “標準接口”是指官方的接口
標準由公認的標準機構確定，或者在下列情況下
為特定的編程語言指定的接口
被廣泛用於使用該語言的開發人員。

  可執行文件的“系統庫”包括其他任何內容
比整個工作，（a）被包括在正常的形式
包裝一個主要組件，但不是該專業的一部分
組件和（b）僅用於使用該工作
主要組件，或實現標準接口
公眾可以以源代碼形式實現實現。一個
在這方面，“主要組成部分”是指主要的組成部分
（內核，窗口系統等）的特定操作系統
（如果有的話），或者編譯器用於
產生工作，或用於運行它的目標代碼解釋器。

  對象代碼形式的“對應來源”意味著全部
生成，安裝和（為可執行文件）所需的源代碼
工作）運行對象代碼並修改工作，包括腳本
控制這些活動。但是，它不包括工作
系統庫或通用工具或一般免費提供
在執行這些活動時不用修改的程序
這不是工作的一部分。例如，對應來源
包括與源文件相關聯的界面定義文件
工作和共享庫的源代碼和動態
鏈接的子程序，工作是專門設計要求，
例如通過親密的數據通信或這些之間的控制流
子程序等部分工作。

  對應來源不需要包含任何用戶
可以從其他部位自動重新生成
資源。

  源代碼形式的工作的相應來源是
同樣的工作

  2.基本權限

  根據本許可授予的所有權利均被授予
該計劃的版權，並且是不可撤銷的規定
條件得到滿足。本許可證明確表明您的無限制
許可運行未修改的程序。運行a的輸出
覆蓋的工作僅在本許可證所涵蓋的情況下才能輸出，給予它
內容構成被覆蓋的作品。本許可證確認您的
合法使用權或其他等同物，由版權法規定。

  你可以製作，運行和傳播你沒有的被覆蓋的作品
只要您的許可證仍然保留，就無條件地傳達
現行。您可以將涵蓋的作品單獨傳達給他人
讓他們專門為您而修改，或提供給您
具有運行這些作品的設施，只要你遵守
本許可證的條款傳達您所做的所有材料
不控製版權。那些因此製作或運行被覆蓋的作品
因為你必須在你的指導下代表你這樣做
並控制，禁止他們製作任何副本
您與版權保護的材料與您之間的關係。

  在任何其他情況下輸送均可單獨使用
條件如下。不許許可; 第10條
使它不必要

  3.保護用戶的合法權益免受反經常法的影響。

  沒有被覆蓋的工作應被視為有效技術的一部分
根據任何適用法律履行條款規定的義務
11，1996年12月20日通過的WIPO版權條約，或
類似的法律禁止或限制規避
措施。

  當你傳達有蓋的工作時，你放棄任何合法的權力來禁止
在規避的範圍內規避技術措施
根據本許可證行使權利
被覆蓋的工作，您不承擔任何限制操作的意圖
修改工作作為對工作的執行手段
用戶，您或第三方的合法權利禁止規避
技術措施。

  輸送逐字複印。

  您可以隨時傳送程序源代碼的逐字副本
接受它，在任何媒介，只要你明顯和
在每個副本上適當發布適當的版權聲明;
保留所有通知，說明本許可證和任何
根據第7條增加的非寬容條款適用於守則;
保留所有沒有任何保證的通知; 並給所有
收到本許可證的副本以及本計劃。

  您可以為您傳送的每個副本收取任何價格或不收取任何費用，
並且您可能會收取支持或保修保護。

  傳送修改的源代碼。

  您可以傳達基於本計劃的工作，或修改
從程序中生成，以源代碼的形式
條款4，條件是您也符合以上所有條件：

    a）工作必須攜帶突出的通知，說明您已修改
    並提供相關日期。

    b）工作必須載明明確的通知
    根據本許可證發布和根據章節添加的任何條件
    這個要求修改了第4節的要求
    “保持完整的所有通知”。

    c）你必須在整個工作的整個過程中授權整個工作
    對任何擁有副本的人的許可。這個
    因此，許可證連同任何適用的第7條一併適用
    附加條款，對整個工作及其所有部分，
    不管它們是如何包裝的。本許可證不給
    允許以任何其他方式許可工作，但不會
    如果您已經單獨收到，則無效此類權限。

    d）如果工作具有交互式用戶界面，則必須顯示
    適當的法律聲明; 但是，如果該程序具有互動性
    沒有顯示適當法律聲明的界面，您的
    工作不需要讓他們這樣做。

  一個涵蓋的工作的彙編與其他獨立和獨立的
作品不是由被覆蓋的作品的性質延伸，
並且它們不與它組合，以便形成更大的程序，
在一個或多個存儲或分發介質的捲中，被稱為
“匯總”，如果編譯及其產生的版權不是
用於限制編輯用戶的訪問權限或合法權限
超出了個人作品允許的範圍。包括被覆蓋的工作
合計不會使本許可證適用於另一方
聚合物的一部分。

  6.傳送非來源表單。

  您可以根據條款傳達目標代碼形式的覆蓋作品
的第4和5節，只要你也傳達
機器可讀對應來源根據本許可證的條款，
以這些方式之一：

    a）將物體代碼傳送到或體現在物理產品中
    （包括物流配送媒介），伴隨著
    對應來源固定在耐用物理介質上
    通常用於軟件交換。

    b）將物體代碼輸入或體現在實體產品中
    （包括物理配送媒介），伴隨著
    書面報價，有效期至少三年，有效期為
    只要您為該產品提供備件或客戶支持
    模型，給予擁有目標代碼的任何人（1）a
    所有軟件的相應源的副本
    本許可證涵蓋的產品，經久耐用
    中等習慣用於軟件交換，價格不限
    超過你體力上的合理成本
    傳送源，或（2）訪問複製
    來自網絡服務器的相應來源免費。

    c）傳送目標代碼的個別副本
    書面報價提供對應來源。這個
    只有偶爾和非商業性才允許選擇
    只有當您收到這樣的報價的目標代碼時，才符合
    與第6b節。

    d）通過提供指定的訪問來傳送目標代碼
    地點（免費或收費），並提供等同的訪問
    相同的來源以相同的方式通過同一個地方
    進一步收費。您不需要收件人復制
    相應的來源以及目標代碼。如果去的地方
    複製目標代碼是一個網絡服務器，對應來源
    可能在不同的服務器（由您或第三方操作）
    如果您維護，則支持等效的複印設施
    清除方向旁邊的對象代碼說哪裡可以找到
    相應來源。不管什麼服務器託管
    對應來源，您仍然有義務確保它
    可用於滿足這些要求所需的時間。

    e）提供使用對等傳輸的傳輸目標代碼
    你通知其他同行的目標代碼和對應
    工作的來源正在向公眾提供
    根據第6d條收費。

  目標代碼的可分離部分，其源代碼被排除
從對應來源作為系統庫，不需要
包括傳送目標代碼工作。

  “用戶產品”是（1）“消費品”，這意味著任何一種
有形的個人財產，通常用於個人，家庭，
或家庭用途，或（2）任何設計或出售成立的事項
進入住宅 在確定產品是否是消費品時，
解決疑似案件有利於保障。對於一個特定的
特定用戶接收的產品，“通常使用”是指a
典型或常用的該類產品，無論狀態如何
特定用戶或特定用戶的方式
實際使用或期望或預期使用該產品。一個產品
是一種消費品，無論產品是否實質
商業，工業或非消費者使用，除非此類用途代表
該產品的唯一重要使用方式。

  用戶產品的“安裝信息”是指任何方法，
程序，授權密鑰或安裝所需的其他信息
並從該用戶產品中執行被覆蓋的工作的修改版本
其對應來源的修改版本。信息必須
足以確保修改後的對象繼續運作
代碼在任何情況下都不會因為原因而被阻止或乾擾
做了修改。

  如果你傳送一個目標代碼工作在這個部分的內部，或與或
專門用於用戶產品，並且傳送發生在
交易的一部分，其中擁有和使用的權利
用戶產品永久轉移給收件人
固定期限（不論交易如何表徵），
必須附有根據本條轉交的相應來源
通過安裝信息。但這個要求不適用
如果您或任何第三方都沒有保留安裝的能力
用戶產品上修改的對象代碼（例如，工作具有
已安裝在ROM中）。

  提供安裝信息的要求不包括
要求繼續提供支持服務，保修或更新
對於由接收者修改或安裝的作品，或為
已修改或安裝的用戶產品。訪問a
當修改本身實質上和網絡可能會被拒絕
不利地影響網絡的運行或違反規則
通過網絡進行通信的協議。

  提供的相應來源和安裝信息，
符合本節必須採用公開的格式
記錄（並在公眾可以使用的實施）
源代碼表），並且不需要特殊的密碼或密鑰
拆包，閱讀或複制。

  7.附加條款。

  “附加權限”是補充此條款的術語
通過從一個或多個條件進行異常來執行許可。
適用於整個計劃的額外權限
被視為在許可證中被包括在內
它們在適用法律下是有效的。如果附加權限
僅適用於程序的一部分，該部分可以單獨使用
根據這些權限，但整個計劃仍然受到管理
本許可證不考慮附加權限。

  當您傳送有蓋工作的副本時，可以根據您的選擇
從該副本或任何部分刪除任何其他權限
它。（附加權限可能需要自己寫入
在某些情況下，當您修改工作時，刪除。）您可以放置
對材料的額外權限，由您加入到覆蓋的工作中，
您有或可以給予適當的版權許可。

  儘管有本許可證的任何其他規定，對於材料您
添加到被覆蓋的工作，您可以（如果版權所有者授權）
該材料）補充本許可條款與條款：

    a）與...不同的保證或限制責任的免責聲明
    本許可證第15和16條的條款; 要么

    b）要求保存指定的合理法律聲明或
    作者在該材料或適當法律中的歸屬
    由包含它的作品顯示的通知; 要么

    c）禁止對該物質的來源作出虛假陳述，或
    要求將此類材料的修改版本標記
    合理的方式與原版不同; 要么

    d）限制用途，以宣傳許可人的名稱或
    材料作者; 要么

    e）拒絕根據商標法授予使用某些權利
    商標，商標或服務標記; 要么

    f）要求賠償許可人和作者
    材料由任何人傳達的材料（或修改版本
    它）對接受者的責任的合同假設
    這些合同假設直接施加的任何責任
    那些許可人和作者。

  所有其他非允許的附加條款被認為是“進一步的
限制“在第10節的意義上。如果程序與你一樣
收到它，或其任何部分，包含一個通知，說明它是
由本許可證管理，並附有一個術語
限制，您可以刪除該術語。如果許可證文件包含
進一步限制，但允許在此下令或傳送
許可證，您可以添加到由條款管理的涵蓋工作材料
該許可證文件，只要進一步的限制
沒有生存這樣的遺傳或傳遞。

  如果您根據本節添加條款到涵蓋的工作，您
必須在相關的源文件中放置一個聲明
適用於這些文件的附加條款或指示的通知
在哪裡可以找到適用的條款。

  附加條款，許可或非允許，可以在
單獨簽發許可證的形式，或作為例外規定;
上述要求適用於任何一種方式。

  8.終止。

  除非有明確的規定，否則您不得傳播或修改被覆蓋的作品
根據本許可證提供。任何嘗試，否則傳播或
修改它是無效的，並將自動終止您的權限
本許可證（包括根據第三條授予的任何專利許可
第11段）。

  但是，如果您停止所有違反本許可證的行為，那麼您的
恢復特定版權持有人的許可（a）
暫時地，除非和直到版權所有者明確和
終於終止您的許可，並且（b）永久地，如果版權
持有人未能以合理的方式通知您違規
在停止60天之前。

  此外，您的特許版權持有人的許可證是
如果版權持有人通知您，永久恢復
違反一些合理的手段，這是你第一次有
收到違反本許可證（任何工作）的通知
版權持有人，並在30天之前解決違規行為
收到通知。

  根據本節終止您的權利並不終止
已收到您的副本或權利的各方的許可證
本許可證。如果您的權利已被終止而不是永久性的
恢復，您不符合獲得相同的新許可
材料在第10節。

  9.複印不需要驗收。

  您不需要接受本許可證才能收到或
運行該程序的副本。覆蓋工作的輔助傳播
僅作為使用對等傳輸的結果而發生
收到副本同樣不需要接受。然而，
除此許可證之外，其他任何內容均不允許您傳播或
修改任何覆蓋的工作。如果您這樣做，這些行為會侵犯版權
不接受本許可證。因此，通過修改或傳播a
表示你接受這個許可證這樣做。

  10.下游收件人的自動許可。

  每次你傳送被覆蓋的作品，收件人自動
從原始許可人收到許可證，運行，修改和
根據本許可證傳播該作品。你不負責任
用於執行第三方遵守本許可證。

  “實體交易”是一種交易轉移控制
組織或實質上所有的資產，或細分
組織或合併組織。如果傳播覆蓋
一個實體交易的工作結果，每一方都是這樣
收到工作副本的交易也會收到
執行黨的前任利益有或可能的工作的執照
給予上一段，加上擁有的權利
相應的來源於前身的興趣，如果
前任擁有或可以合理地努力。

  您不可以對此行使施加任何進一步的限制
根據本許可證授予或確認的權利。例如，你可以
不徵收執照費，使用費或其他費用
根據本許可授予的權利，您不得提起訴訟
（包括訴訟中的交叉索賠或反訴訟）指稱
任何專利權利要求都是通過製作，使用，銷售和出售而受到侵害的
銷售或導入本計劃或其任何部分。

  專利。

  “貢獻者”是授權使用此版權的版權所有者
該計劃的許可或該計劃所依據的工作。該
這樣獲得許可的工作稱為貢獻者的“貢獻者版本”。

  貢獻者的“基本專利權利要求”都是專利權利要求
由貢獻者擁有或控制，無論是已獲得還是
以後被收購的，被以某種方式侵犯的
通過本許可，製作，使用或出售其貢獻者版本，
但不包括僅作為一項侵權的聲明
進一步修改貢獻者版本的後果。對於
這個定義的目的，“控制”包括授權的權利
專利次級許可方式符合要求
本許可證。

  每個貢獻者都會授予您非全球性的免版稅
專利許可證根據貢獻者的必要專利權利要求
製造，使用，銷售，出售，進口或以其他方式運行，修改和
傳播其貢獻者版本的內容。

  在以下三段中，“專利許可”是任何明示
協議或承諾，不論是否授權，不執行專利
（如明示許可，不得執行專利或契約
起訴專利侵權）。向“授予”這樣的專利許可證
締約方意味著作出這樣的協議或承諾不執行
專利反對黨。

  如果您傳達有蓋工作，明知依靠專利許可，
並且任何人都不能使用相應的工作來源
根據本許可證的條款免費複製，通過a
公共網絡服務器或其他易於訪問的手段，
那麼你必須（1）使對應來源如此
可用，或（2）安排剝奪自己的利益
這項工作的專利許可證，或（3）以某種方式安排
符合本許可證的要求，擴大專利
授權下游收件人。“知道依賴”意味著你有
實際知識，但是對於專利許可，你的傳達
在一個國家覆蓋工作，或收件人使用被覆蓋的工作
在一個國家，將侵犯一個或多個可識別的專利
你有理由認為有效的國家。

  如果，根據或與單個交易相關或
安排，你傳達或傳播通過採購a，
並向某些方授予專利許可
接收授權他們使用，傳播，修改的被覆蓋的工作
或傳達被覆蓋的工作的具體副本，然後傳遞專利許可
您的贈款將自動擴展到所有受保護的收件人
基於工作和工作。

  如果專利許可證不包括在內，則是“歧視性的”
其覆蓋範圍，禁止行使，或是
條件是不行使一個或多個權利
特別授予本許可證。你不能傳達一個被覆蓋的
如果你是與第三方的安排的締約方，工作
在分發軟件的業務中，您在此付款
根據您的傳達活動的程度向第三方發送
第三方給予的任何工作
從你那裡得到被覆蓋的工作的各方，是歧視的
專利許可證（a）涉及被覆蓋工作的副本
由你傳達（或由這些副本製作的副本），或（b）主要
對於和特定的產品或編譯有關
包含被覆蓋的工作，除非你訂立了這個安排，
或在2007年3月28日之前授予專利許可。

  本許可證中的任何內容不得視為排除或限制
任何隱含的許可證或其他可能的侵權辯護
否則根據適用的專利法向您提供。

  12.沒有人屈服於其他人的自由。

  如果對你施加條件（無論是通過法院命令，協議還是
否則）與本許可證的條件相矛盾，他們不會
請不要從本許可證的條件。如果你不能傳達一個
涵蓋工作，以同時滿足您在此下的義務
許可證和任何其他相關義務，因此您可能會
根本不傳達。例如，如果您同意有義務的條款
從你傳達給你的人那裡收集一些版稅
該計劃，唯一的方式，你可以滿足這兩個條款和這一點
許可證將完全不會傳達該計劃。

  13.與GNU Affero通用公共許可證一起使用。

  儘管有本許可證的任何其他規定，您有
允許鏈接或組合任何被覆蓋的工作與工作許可
將GNU Affero通用公共許可證的版本3下載到一個
組合工作，並傳達所產生的工作。這個條款
許可證將繼續適用於被覆蓋工作的部分，
但是GNU Affero通用公共許可證的特殊要求，
關於通過網絡進行交互的第13節將適用於
組合本身。

  14.本許可證的修訂版本。

  自由軟件基金會可能會發布修訂版和/或新版本
GNU通用公共許可證不時。這樣的新版本會
在精神上類似於現在的版本，但可能會有所不同
解決新問題或疑慮。

  每個版本都有一個不同的版本號。如果
程序指定了GNU General的某個編號版本
公共許可證“或任何更新版本”適用於您，您擁有
遵循條款和條件的選項是編號的
版本或免費軟件發布的任何更新版本
基礎。如果程序沒有指定版本號
GNU通用公共許可證，您可以選擇任何已發布的版本
由自由軟件基金會。

  如果程序指定代理可以決定哪個未來
可以使用GNU通用公共許可證的版本，該代理的
公開接受版本的聲明永久授權給您
選擇該程序的版本。

  以後的許可證版本可能會給你額外的或不同的
權限。但是，沒有對任何附加義務
作者或版權所有者，因為您選擇遵循
後期版本。

  15.免責聲明。

  在程序允許的範圍內，不作任何保證
適用法律。除非另有書面說明版權
持有人和/或其他方按“原樣”提供計劃，不附帶任何擔保
無論是明示或暗示的，包括但不限於，
對適銷性和特定適用性的默示保證
目的。對程序的質量和性能的完整風險
和你在一起 應計劃有缺陷，您應該承擔費用
所有必要的維修，修理或更正。

  16.責任限制。

  除非適用法律要求或同意書面許可
任何版權所有者或任何其他修改和/或侵權的其他方
上述允許的程序，對您造成的損害負責，包括任何
一般，特殊，偶發或後果性損害
使用或無法使用計劃（包括但不限於損失）
數據或數據被提交不正確或由您或第三者繼續損失
締約方或程序未能執行任何其他方案），
即使此類持有人或其他方已被告知可能
這樣的損害。

  17.第15和16節的解釋。

  如果提供免責聲明的保證和責任限制
以上不能按照其條款給予當地法律效力，
審查法院應適用最接近的當地法律
絕對放棄所有與此有關的民事責任
計劃，除非擔保或承擔責任陪同
該計劃的副本作為收費回報。

                     條款和條件終止

            如何將這些條款應用於您的新程序

  如果你開發一個新的程序，並希望它是最大的
可能對公眾使用，實現這一目標的最好辦法就是做到
免費軟件，每個人都可以根據這些條款重新分配和更改。

  為此，請將以下通知附加到程序中。這是最安全的
以最有效的方式將它們附加到每個源文件的開頭
聲明不包括保修; 並且每個文件應至少具有
“版權”行和指向找到完整通知的位置的指針。

    {一行給出程序的名稱和簡短的想法。
    版權所有（C）{年} {作者姓名}

    此程序是免費軟件：您可以重新分配和/或修改
    它根據GNU通用公共許可證的條款發布
    自由軟件基金會，版本3的許可證，或
    （根據您的選擇）任何更高版本。

    這個程序是分發的，希望它是有用的，
    但不提供任何保證; 甚至沒有隱含的保證
    適銷性或適用於特定目的。見
    更多細節，GNU通用公共許可證。

    您應該已經收到GNU通用公共許可證的副本
    以及這個程序。如果沒有，請參閱<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>。

還可以添加有關如何通過電子郵件和紙張郵件與您聯繫的信息。

  如果程序執行終端互動，使其輸出一個短
